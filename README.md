# Org-XMLNodeToXMLDocument
This org mode file documents the protocol for Monty's XML package
from XMLNode down to XMLDocument and XMLElment.

It just provides some doits for most methods in the hierarchy.

It is useful for familiarizing oneself with the protocol 
and it helps conceptulize XML terms for newbies.
